Curated Dataset: Web-Scraped Scanned PDFs with Ground Truth Statements in Excel


This meticulously crafted dataset comprises web-scraped PDFs alongside corresponding ground truth statements, organized in Excel format. Leveraging advanced web scraping techniques, it serves as a valuable resource for diverse data-driven tasks. Each PDF is meticulously scanned for comprehensive coverage, with ground truth statements meticulously validated. 

The dataset includes data in both tabular and non-tabular formats, with the ground truth exclusively representing the largest table in PDFs with multiple tables. This ensures accuracy in reflecting the most extensive dataset available.Special thanks to https://github.com/JensWalter/my-receipts for providing some of the scanned PDFs as used in this dataset.
